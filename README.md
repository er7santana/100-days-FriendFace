# Friend Face

App made using SwiftUI to display a list of friend items downloaded from the server

## Features

- Fetch the data and parse it into User and Friend structs.
- Display a list of users with a little information about them, such as their name and whether they are active right now.
- Create a detail view shown when a user is tapped, presenting more information about them, including the names of their friends.
- Before you start your download, check that your User array is empty so that you donâ€™t keep starting the download every time the view is shown.
